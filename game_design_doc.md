# Game Design Document: Tradeborn Realms

## Game Overview
Tradeborn Realms is a web-based fantasy trading game that invites players into a whimsical world where kingdoms rise and fall on the strength of market savvy and daring investments. Instead of real-world stocks, players trade shares in fictional guilds, magical commodities, mythical beasts, and powerful empires—each with their own procedurally generated backstories and news cycles that drive market dynamics.

Set in a richly detailed fantasy realm, the game combines the strategic depth of trading with the immersive storytelling of a living, breathing world. Players begin with a pouch of enchanted coin—purely fictional currency—to invest in an ever-shifting marketplace influenced by procedurally generated events such as dragon sightings, magical disasters, guild wars, and royal scandals.

This simulated trading environment offers a safe and engaging way to learn about trading strategies, risk management, and economic principles without the pressure of real financial consequences. The web-based interface is fast, intuitive, and accessible across devices, making it easy for newcomers to jump in and start trading while offering enough depth to keep experienced strategists engaged.

Whether you're speculating on the rising price of Phoenix Feather futures or shorting shares in a struggling Alchemist’s Guild, Tradeborn Realms transforms financial education into an epic game of wit, timing, and magical intuition. Will you become the richest merchant in the realm or be humbled by an unexpected goblin recession?

## Marketing
Tradeborn Realms is a fantasy trading realm where magic meets money. Buy and sell shares in mythical guilds, rare resources, and legendary beasts—all influenced by dynamic, procedurally generated events. Master the markets, outwit rival traders, and rise to power in a world where fortune favors the bold. No real money, just pure strategy and fantasy fun!
